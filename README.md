# Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM)
HAXM is a cross-platform hardware-assisted virtualization engine (hypervisor),
widely used as an accelerator for [Android Emulator][android-studio] and
[QEMU][qemu]. It has always supported running on Windows and macOS, and has been
ported to other host operating systems as well, such as Linux and NetBSD.

HAXM runs as a kernel-mode driver on the host operating system, and provides a
KVM-like interface to user space, thereby enabling applications like QEMU to
utilize the hardware virtualization capabilities built into modern Intel CPUs,
namely [Intel Virtualization Technology][intel-vt].

## Downloads
The latest HAXM release for Windows and macOS hosts are available
[here][github-haxm-latest-release].
